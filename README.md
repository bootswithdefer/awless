`awless` is a powerful, innovative and small surface command line interface (CLI) to manage Amazon Web Services.

> **This is a modernized fork of [wallix/awless](https://github.com/wallix/awless)** (via [babyhuey/awless](https://github.com/babyhuey/awless)), which was last released in 2018. It migrates to AWS SDK v2, replaces `dep`/vendor with Go modules, adds multiple new AWS services, and fixes a number of bugs that the SDK migration left behind. See [Changes in this fork](#changes-in-this-fork).

[Upstream Wiki](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki) | [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

The upstream wiki is still the best guide to concepts — the template language, the sync
model and the getting-started tour are unchanged. Where this fork differs, it is noted
below.

# Why awless

`awless` stands out by having the following characteristics:

- small and hierarchical set of commands
- a simple/powerful text [templating language](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki/Templates) to create and **revert** fully-fledged infrastructures
- wrapping/composing AWS API calls when necessary to enrich behavior. Ex: ensure smart defaults, security best practices, etc.
- local log of all your cloud modifications done through `awless` to list/revert past actions
- sync to a local graph storage of your cloud representation
- exploration of your cloud infrastructure and resources interrelations, **even offline** using the local graph storage
- clearer and flexible terminal output's with: numerous formats (machine/human friendly), enriched resources's properties/relations when feasible
- connect easily using awless' **smart SSH** to your private & public instances

For more read our [FAQ](#faq) below (how `awless` compares to other tools, etc.)

# Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install --cask bootswithdefer/tap/awless
```

A cask rather than a formula because it ships the pre-built binary; Homebrew reserves
formulae for software built from source. Upgrade with `brew upgrade --cask awless`.

### From source

Requires Go 1.26+ (the version is pinned in `go.mod`):

```sh
go install github.com/bootswithdefer/awless@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bootswithdefer/awless.git
cd awless
make build
```

### Pre-built binaries

Releases are built by GoReleaser for Linux, macOS and Windows on amd64 and arm64, with
checksums — see [Releases](https://github.com/bootswithdefer/awless/releases).

### Development setup

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # gofmt + lint before each commit
make tools                            # install pinned dev tools
make verify                           # the full gate: fmt, vet, lint, race, vuln
```

`make help` lists every target. Contributors should read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), which
documents the code generation pipeline and the reflective command-spec system — the two
things most likely to surprise you.

### Configuration

If you have previously used the AWS CLI or aws-shell, you don't need to configure anything! Your config will be automatically loaded (i.e. `~/.aws/{credentials,config}`) and `awless` will prompt for any missing info (more at the [getting started wiki](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki/Getting-Started)).

# Main features

- **Aliasing of resources through their natural name** so you don't have to always use cryptic ids that are impossible to remember
- `awless show` : Explore the properties, relations, dependencies of a specific resource (even offline thanks to the sync) given only a *name* (or id/arn).

      $ awless show jsmith --local

- `awless list` : Clear and easy listing of multi-region cloud resources with filters via *resources properties* or *resources tags*.

      $ awless list instances --sort uptime --local
      $ awless list instances --all-local-regions
      $ awless list users --format csv --columns name,created

- `awless run` : Create, update and delete complex infrastructures with smart defaults and sound auto-complete through awless templates.

      $ awless run ~/templates/my-infra.aws
      etc.

- **320 CRUD one-liners** integrated in the awless templating engine, each with `-h`
  documentation and worked examples:

      $ awless create instance -h
      $ awless create vpc -h
      $ awless attach policy -h
      $ awless create secret name=db-password secret=s3cr3t
      $ awless create ssmparameter name=/app/db/host value=db.internal type=SecureString
      $ awless create dynamodbtable name=users partition-key=id
      $ ...
      (see awless -h)

- `awless log` : Detailed and easy reporting of all the CLI template executions
- `awless revert` : Revert of executed templates and resources creation
- Create instances straight from a distro name. No need to know the region or AMI ;) (_free tier community bare distro only_, see `awless create instance -h`)

      $ awless create instance distro=debian
      $ awless create instance distro=coreos
      $ awless create instance distro=redhat::7.2 type=t2.micro
      $ awless create instance distro=debian:debian:jessie lock=true
      $ awless create instance distro=amazonlinux:amzn2
      $ awless create instance type=t2.micro ebs-optimized=true
      etc.

- Leveraging AWS `userdata` to provision instance on creation from remote (i.e http) or local scripts: `awless create instance ... userdata=/home/john/...`
- `awless ssh` : Clean and simple SSH to public & private instances using only a name

      $ awless ssh my-production-instance
      $ awless ssh redis-prod --through jump-server
      $ awless ssh 34.215.29.221
      $ awless ssh db-private --private
      $ awless ssh 172.31.77.151 --port 2222 --through my-proxy --through-port 23
      $ ...
      (see awless ssh -h)

- `awless switch` : Switch easily between AWS accounts (i.e. profile) and regions

      $ awless switch admin eu-west-2
      $ awless switch us-west-1
      $ awless switch mfa
      etc.

- `awless` transparently syncs cloud resources locally to a graph representation in order for the CLI to leverage data and their relations in other awless commands and in an offline manner ([more on the sync](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki/Getting-Started#sync))
- `awless sync` : Explicit and manual command to fetch & store resources locally. Then query & inspect your cloud offline
- Output listing formats either human (**default display is Markdown-compatible tables**) or machine readable (csv, tsv, json, ...): `--format`
- `awless inspect` : Leverage **experimental** and community inspectors which are interface implementation utilities to run analysis on your cloud resources graphs

      $ awless inspect -i bucket_sizer
      (see awless inspect -h)

- `awless completion` : CLI autocompletion for Unix/Linux's bash and zsh

# Changes in this fork

### Platform

- **AWS SDK v2** throughout, replacing the v1 SDK
- **Go modules**, replacing `dep` and a vendor directory
- **Go 1.26**, with the toolchain pinned in `go.mod`
- **`github.com/bootswithdefer/triplestore` v1.0.0** for graph storage, the first tagged
  release that library has ever had
- **bbolt** replaces the archived `boltdb/bolt`, which crashes under the race detector

### New services

36 AWS services added, all writable rather than list-only. EKS, DynamoDB, Secrets
Manager, KMS, API Gateway v2, SSM, EFS, CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs, ElastiCache,
EventBridge, Step Functions, WAF v2, AWS Config, Kinesis, Redshift, CodePipeline,
CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, Transit Gateway, CodeDeploy, Glue, SES v2, Cognito,
MSK, Amazon MQ, FSx, Global Accelerator, VPC Peering, Cloud Map, AWS Backup, VPC
Endpoints, Direct Connect, and Network Manager (Cloud WAN).

### Bugs fixed

Nine of these came from the SDK v1 → v2 migration and were invisible to the compiler,
because `awless` maps template parameters onto AWS request structs by reflection:

- `create role`, `create/update distribution`, `attach/detach securitygroup` and four
  `containertask` commands all failed — the reflective call passed the request without the
  context that SDK v2 requires
- 35 parameters that take a list of strings panicked, because v1 modeled them as
  `[]*string` and v2 uses `[]string`
- 13 parameters that take a list of structs panicked, for the same reason
- `create instance count` reached neither `MinCount` nor `MaxCount`, from a one-character
  typo in a struct tag
- `update classicloadbalancer` silently sent an empty request: its field paths were
  spelled `Healthcheck` where the SDK field is `HealthCheck`
- `create distribution` silently dropped its origin domain, because indexed field paths
  such as `Origins.Items[0].DomainName` were not resolved
- `create/start/stop instance`, `create listener`, `create loadbalancer` and
  `create targetgroup` panicked on an empty AWS response
- `create vpc` without `name=` crashed while trying to tag the new VPC
- `awless log` crashed on a comment-only or empty template

And, found separately:

- **Secrets were written to the template log in cleartext** — command lines, fillers and
  messages all persisted `password=` values. They are now redacted at the persistence
  boundary.
- **The web UI listened on `0.0.0.0` with no authentication or timeouts.** It now defaults
  to loopback and requires an explicit opt-in to expose.
- **A deadlock in the IAM users fetcher**, plus an unsynchronized error flag.
- **Ten fan-out sites leaked goroutines** on the first error and ran unbounded, which
  throttled large accounts. All now use a bounded `errgroup`.
- **`awless` exited 0 on failure**, which broke shell scripting.
- **A denial of service in `triplestore`'s decoder**: an 11-byte input could request 3.8 GB
  and kill the process. Found with fuzzing.

### Upstream issues closed

- [#296](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/296): `--filter` now uses exact matching instead of substring matching
- [#281](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/281): Added `ebs-optimized` flag to `create instance`
- [#289](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/289): RDS endpoint now shown in `list databases`

### Removed

- **The scheduler is gone.** `--run-in`, `--revert-in` and the hidden `awless scheduler`
  command required a daemon that had been unbuildable since 2018 and exposed an
  unauthenticated endpoint that executed templates against the host's AWS credentials.
  Use EventBridge Scheduler, cron, or a CI schedule instead.

### Breaking changes

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). The one to know about: `https-behaviour` is now
`https-behavior` on `create/update distribution`, for consistency with the American
spelling used everywhere else. Existing templates must be updated, and reverting a
previously logged distribution creation will fail because the stored command line carries
the old spelling.

### Engineering

- **361 acceptance tests covering all 320 commands**, running with no network access
- 51 linters enabled, including `errcheck`, `errorlint`, `noctx`, `contextcheck`,
  `musttag` and `bidichk`
- Native Go fuzzing, `govulncheck` in CI, and CI actions pinned to commit SHAs
- Ctrl-C cancels in-flight AWS calls, via a signal-cancelled root context threaded to
  every request

# FAQ

**There are already some AWS CLIs. What is `awless` unique approach?**

Three things that differentiate `awless` from other AWS CLIs:

* It has its own **compiled and very simple templating language** to build AWS infrastructures.
* Commands are made of _VERB + ENTITY [+ param=value]_ and are actually valid lines of the template language.
* It transparently syncs to a local graph a representation of the cloud resources and their relations.

**How do you create infrastructure with `awless`?**

You build infrastructure using `template files` or `command one-liners` that get compiled and run through `awless` builtin engine. Learn [more about the way templates work](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki/Templates).

Note that all your actions against the cloud are logged. Templates are revertible/rollbackable.

**How does `awless` compare to Terraform?**

Terraform is much broader in scope. `awless` takes a different approach:

- Favors simplicity with a straight forward, compiled and simple deployment language
- Employs an all-or-nothing deployment: does not keep state
- Provides rollback on any ran template
- Logs all actions against the cloud with rich, revertable logs

**Is this fork maintained?**

Yes. CI is green, every command has an acceptance test, and releases are published for
Linux, macOS and Windows — install with Homebrew or grab a binary from
[Releases](https://github.com/bootswithdefer/awless/releases). Bug reports and
contributions are welcome.

# About

`awless` was originally created by Henri Binsztok, Quentin Bourgerie, Simon Caplette and Francois-Xavier Aguessy at [WALLIX](https://github.com/wallix). This fork is maintained by [bootswithdefer](https://github.com/bootswithdefer).

`awless` is released under the Apache License.

    Disclaimer: Awless allows for easy resource creation with your cloud provider;
    we will not be responsible for any cloud costs incurred (even if you create a
    million instances using awless templates).

Contributors are welcome! Note that `awless` uses [triplestore](https://github.com/bootswithdefer/triplestore), another project originally developed at WALLIX and also forked here.
