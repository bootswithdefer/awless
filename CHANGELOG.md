## v1.4.1

### Fixed

- **Direct Connect fetchers were missing.** All five resource types (connections, virtual
  interfaces, LAGs, gateways, gateway associations) were defined but never implemented,
  causing `list directconnectgateways` and siblings to fail with "no fetch func defined".
  Implemented with continuation-token loops (the SDK still publishes no paginators).

- **Network Manager child resource fetchers were missing.** Sites, links, devices, and
  connections were defined but the manual fetcher stub was empty. Implemented with SDK
  paginators fanning out per global network.

- **7 stdlib vulnerabilities** (GO-2026-5026, GO-2026-5972, GO-2026-6088, GO-2026-6089,
  GO-2026-6090, GO-2026-6091, GO-2026-6218) fixed by bumping the toolchain to go1.26.6.

### Changed

- `make vuln` now sets `GOTOOLCHAIN` from the `go.mod` toolchain directive so it catches
  the same stdlib vulnerabilities locally that CI catches.

- Full Go module update (`go get -u ./...`).

## v1.4.0

### Added

- **Direct Connect support.** Five resource types: connections, virtual interfaces, LAGs,
  gateways, and gateway associations. Gateways and associations support create/delete;
  connections, VIFs, and LAGs are list-only (physical resources ordered through the portal).
  All fetchers use continuation-token loops because the SDK publishes no paginators.

- **Network Manager (Cloud WAN) support.** Seven resource types: global networks, core
  networks, sites, links, devices, connections, and peerings. All except peerings support
  create/delete. Sites, links, devices, and connections fan out per global network (the API
  requires `GlobalNetworkId`). Peerings are list-only (created implicitly by attachments).

- 16 new CRUD commands across both services. 21 acceptance tests with input mapping
  assertions and empty-response safety coverage.

### Changed

- Full Go module update (`go get -u ./...`). AWS SDK modules and all third-party
  dependencies upgraded to latest.

## v1.3.0

### Fixed

- **All-numeric hyphenated values are accepted unquoted.** A UUID, an ISO date
  (`2024-02-09`) and an ISO timestamp were all rejected, because the int-range rule matched
  their leading digits-dash-digits and the parser does not reconsider once a rule has
  matched. This mattered most for AWS Backup, whose plan IDs are UUIDs. Port ranges such as
  `22-80` are unchanged, and quoting — the documented workaround — still works.

### Added

- **`awless list --all-local-regions`** merges a resource type from every locally synced
  region into one listing and adds a region column. Reads only the local graph, so it makes
  no AWS calls, and `awless show` already had the equivalent. The region is recorded per
  resource as the graph is loaded, because nothing in a synced graph carries it — the region
  is expressed only by which directory the file sits in. Without that, two same-named
  resources in different regions would be indistinguishable.

## v1.2.1

### Added

- **Tests for the two hand-written fetch patterns.** Services that publish no paginator carry a
  continuation-token loop, and resources AWS will not list globally are fetched per parent.
  Both fail by returning a short list with no error, which is the worst shape of bug for a tool
  whose job is showing you what you have. Verified by backing each pattern out.

### Fixed

- **Profiles requiring MFA could not be used at all.** Any profile with `mfa_serial` failed
  with `assume role with MFA enabled, but AssumeRoleTokenProvider session option not set`
  before awless could even resolve a region. There is now a stdin token provider, and the
  code that looks up a profile's region reads the shared config files instead of resolving
  the whole credential chain — looking up a region should not need credentials.
- **Assumed-role credentials were not cached, so MFA would be re-entered on every
  invocation.** The on-disk cache had survived the SDK v2 migration already implementing the
  v2 interface, but was never wired in; its only remaining reference was a TODO naming a
  second provider that no longer exists. Now wired in, keyed by profile, written 0600.
- **The credential cache ignored the credential's own expiry**, assuming a flat fifteen
  minutes. A profile with `duration_seconds = 3600` therefore re-prompted for MFA four times
  an hour. It now honors the reported expiration, less a one-minute margin so a long sync
  cannot start with a valid credential and finish without one.
- **`AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` are honored** when reading a
  profile's region. The config-only loader does not consult them the way the full loader
  does, so they had to be passed explicitly.

## v1.2.0

### Added

- **ElastiCache.** Cache clusters, replication groups and cache subnet groups, with
  `list`, and eight create/update/delete commands. `awless ls cacheclusters`,
  `awless create replicationgroup id=sessions description=Sessions engine=redis
  type=cache.t3.micro clusters=3 automatic-failover=true`, and so on.
- **EventBridge.** Event buses and rules, with `list`, and nine commands including
  `start`/`stop` on a rule and `attach`/`detach` for rule targets.
  `awless create eventrule name=nightly schedule="rate(1 hour)"`, then
  `awless attach eventtarget rule=nightly id=report arn=<lambda-arn>`.
- **AWS Backup.** Backup plans and vaults, with create and delete. A plan is a list of rules
  each with its own schedule, lifecycle and target vault, so it comes from a JSON file.
- **Cloud Map.** Namespaces and services, with create and delete. Giving `create namespace` a
  VPC makes it private-DNS backed; without one it is HTTP-only, which is a different API call.
- **VPC Peering.** Peering connections with create/delete, plus `start vpcpeering` to accept
  a pending request — creating one leaves it pending until the other side accepts.
- **Global Accelerator.** Accelerators with create/update/delete and their listeners with
  create/delete. The required idempotency token is generated rather than asked for.
- **FSx.** File systems and backups, with create and delete. The entity is
  `fsxfilesystem`, since EFS already owns `filesystem` and the two are different products.
- **Amazon MQ.** Brokers, with create and delete. The initial user credentials are passed as
  a file rather than on the command line, so a password does not end up in shell history or
  the template log.
- **MSK.** Kafka clusters, with create and delete. The entity is `kafkacluster`, since ECS,
  EKS and Redshift already have clusters of their own.
- **Cognito.** User pools and identity pools, with create and delete. These are two
  different APIs that are easy to confuse: a user pool is a directory of users, an identity
  pool hands AWS credentials to them.
- **SES v2.** Email identities and configuration sets, with create and delete. Creating an
  identity starts verification rather than completing it: a domain still needs DNS records
  published and an address still needs a link clicked.
- **Glue.** Catalog databases, tables, crawlers and jobs, with create/delete and
  `start`/`stop` on a crawler and `start` on a job. The entities are `gluedatabase` and
  `gluetable`, since `database` belongs to RDS and a bare `table` would not say which
  catalog it means.
- **CodeDeploy.** Applications and deployment groups, plus creating and stopping a
  deployment. The entity is `deployapplication`, because Elastic Beanstalk already owns
  `application` and the template language has one flat namespace.
- **Transit Gateway and VPC Endpoints.** Transit gateways, their VPC attachments and route
  tables, plus gateway and interface endpoints. Both ride the EC2 client the rest of the
  infra service already uses, so they also get dry-run support.
- **Document-shaped inputs.** Some AWS inputs are documents rather than flags, and now take
  a JSON file: `awless create pipeline definition-file=build-and-deploy.json`, and
  `create webacl` / `create rulegroup` with their default action, visibility config and
  rules. The file uses the same camelCase shape the AWS CLI accepts. A misspelled key is
  rejected rather than dropped.
- **Elastic Beanstalk.** Applications and environments, both with create/update/delete.
  `awless update environment name=web-api-prod version=build-43` deploys a version;
  `delete environment` maps to Beanstalk's TerminateEnvironment.
- **CodeBuild.** Build projects with create/update/delete, and `start`/`stop` to run a
  build. `awless start buildproject name=api-build source-version=release-2.0` returns the
  build id that `stop` takes.
- **CodePipeline.** Pipelines are listed, deleted, and run: `awless start pipeline
  name=build-and-deploy` returns the execution id that `awless stop pipeline` takes.
  Creation is not offered — a pipeline is a whole document of stages and actions rather than
  a set of flags, and is normally defined in CloudFormation or Terraform; what those tools
  do not give you is a way to operate it.
- **Redshift.** Clusters and cluster subnet groups, with create/update/delete.
  `awless create redshiftcluster id=analytics username=admin type=ra3.xlplus
  manage-password=true` — `manage-password` keeps the credential in Secrets Manager and out
  of the template log.
- **Kinesis.** Data streams, with create/delete and resharding via `update stream`.
  `awless create stream name=clickstream mode=ON_DEMAND`.
- **AWS Config.** Config rules, with create/update/delete, and each rule annotated with its
  compliance status — which is the reason to look at Config at all and comes from a second
  API. `awless ls configrules` shows COMPLIANT or NON_COMPLIANT per rule;
  `awless create configrule name=s3-versioning source=S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED`.
- **WAF v2.** Web ACLs, IP sets and rule groups are listed and synced across both scopes,
  and IP sets have full create/update/delete. `awless create ipset name=blocklist
  addresses=203.0.113.0/24`. The address family is inferred from the addresses, and delete
  and update look up WAF's LockToken themselves rather than asking for it.

  Web ACL and rule group creation is not included: both need nested action and visibility
  structures that the reflective setter has no shape for yet. Listing and deletion work.
- **Step Functions.** State machines, with `list` and create/update/delete, plus
  `start`/`stop` on an execution. The state machine definition is passed as a file:
  `awless create statemachine name=order-flow role=<role-arn> definition-file=flow.json`.
  Executions are deliberately not a listed resource — enumerating them needs one call per
  state machine, for run history rather than infrastructure.

### Changed for importers

- **`awsconfig.StdinRegionSelector` and `StdinInstanceTypeSelector` now return
  `(string, error)`** rather than `string`. No CLI behaviour depends on this — it is what
  allowed an `os.Exit` to be removed from library code — but it is a source-breaking change
  for anyone vendoring `aws/config`. No major version bump was taken: Go would require the
  module path to become `.../awless/v2`, which is a far larger break for a CLI nothing
  imports.

### Fixed

- **A resource type ending in "s" was unlistable.** `PluralizeResource` appended a bare
  `s`, so `eventbus` became `eventbuss` and no lookup could resolve it back. Irregular
  plurals are now listed explicitly, and a test round-trips every resource type.
- **Seven documented CLI examples could not be run.** Two omitted the resource entirely
  (`awless create name=admins` rather than `awless create group name=admins`), three
  omitted the binary name, one had a stray `/` where an access key id belonged, and one
  event pattern used an escape the template grammar does not support. Examples are now
  parsed by the grammar in CI, not just checked for param names.
- **`awless revert` produced an invalid template for eight resources.** The revert builder
  falls back to `id=<result>`, but `apigatewaystage`, `dynamodbtable`, `ekscluster`,
  `eksnodegroup`, `loggroup`, `ssmparameter` and `trail` all have a `delete` command that
  accepts only `name`, so reverting their creation failed with `unexpected param id`. Seven
  of the eight shipped in earlier releases; the failure only surfaced when a revert was
  actually run.

- **Interactive prompts spun forever on a closed or piped stdin.** `awless config set
  <key>` and the instance-type selector both looped on `fmt.Scan` while discarding its
  error, and `fmt.Scan` returns its error without assigning — so neither loop could make
  progress once stdin was exhausted. Measured at 200,001 iterations in 300ms, burning a
  core until killed. `awless config set region < /dev/null` was enough to trigger it. Both
  now read with a `bufio.Scanner` and abort with a clear error.
- **Ctrl-C at the region prompt called `os.Exit(1)` from library code**, skipping deferred
  cleanup. Both stdin selectors now return an error, so the abort travels through the
  normal path to `main`.
- **`awless ssh` reported a nil error** when given an empty username list, rendering
  `Last error: %!w(<nil>)`.

### Removed

- `ISSUES.md` and `PLAN.md`. Every tracked item was closed, so both had become historical
  records that misreported their own status. The decisions worth keeping — why `gosec` is
  not a build gate, why Classic ELB support stays, why five functions are left untested —
  moved to `AGENTS.md` under Deliberate Omissions.

## v1.1.2

### Fixed

- **Runtime errors printed the entire usage block before the error.** An expired AWS
  credential produced 28 lines of flag documentation ahead of the one line explaining what
  went wrong:

  ```
  $ awless -p some-profile list instances
  USAGE:
    awless list instances [flags]
  ... 25 lines of flags ...
  [error]  failed to refresh cached credentials, ... ExpiredToken
  ```

  Cobra prints a command's usage for any error returned from `RunE` unless `SilenceUsage`
  is set, and it was not. Usage is now suppressed once flags and arguments have been
  parsed, so a genuine usage mistake such as an unknown flag still prints it while a
  runtime failure does not.

## v1.1.1

### Added

- **Homebrew.** `brew install --cask bootswithdefer/tap/awless`, published to
  [bootswithdefer/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/bootswithdefer/homebrew-tap) by the
  release pipeline.

  A cask rather than a formula because it ships the pre-built binary; Homebrew reserves
  formulae for software built from source. Upgrade with `brew upgrade --cask awless`.

  The cask clears the macOS quarantine attribute on install, without which Gatekeeper
  blocks the first run of a downloaded binary with no useful explanation.

### Fixed

- **The update check told Homebrew users to download a tarball by hand.**
  `config.BuildFor` is fixed at build time, and the cask and the tarballs are cut from the
  same artifacts, so it could not tell them apart — the `brew` branch of the upgrade hint
  was unreachable. The binary now checks whether it is running from inside a Homebrew
  prefix and suggests `brew upgrade awless` when it is.

## v1.1.0

First release of this fork. Everything below is relative to upstream
[wallix/awless](https://github.com/wallix/awless) v0.1.11, released in 2018.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`https-behaviour` renamed to `https-behavior`** on `create distribution` and
  `update distribution`, for consistency with the American spelling used everywhere
  else and enforced by the `misspell` linter.

  Templates and one-liners using `https-behaviour=` must be updated. Reverting a
  previously logged distribution creation will also fail, since the persisted command
  line carries the old parameter name.

- **The web UI now listens on loopback.** `awless web` was serving on `0.0.0.0:8080`
  with no authentication and no timeouts. Exposing it beyond localhost is now an
  explicit opt-in.

### Removed

- **Scheduler support.** `awless run --run-in`, `--revert-in`, the hidden `awless scheduler`
  command and the `scheduler.url` config key are gone, along with the dependency on
  `github.com/wallix/awless-scheduler`.

  None of them worked: the scheduler daemon imported `awless/aws/driver` and
  `awless/template/driver`, both removed during the AWS SDK v2 migration, so it could not
  be built against any recent version of awless. Upstream's README declared it deprecated
  for that reason. These flags appeared in `--help` but could never succeed.

  For deferred infrastructure changes use EventBridge Scheduler, cron with `awless`, or a
  CI schedule. `awless revert` on a logged template execution covers the manual case.

### Added

- **Eight new AWS services, all writable rather than list-only.** EKS, DynamoDB, Secrets
  Manager, KMS, API Gateway v2, SSM, EFS, CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs, adding 27
  create/update/delete commands.
- **`awless create secret` / `create ssmparameter`** and the rest of the new commands each
  carry `-h` documentation, worked examples and enumerated valid values.
- Every command now has a documented CLI example; `awless <action> <entity> -h` shows one.

### Fixed

Nine of these came from the SDK v1 → v2 migration and were invisible to the compiler,
because `awless` maps template parameters onto AWS request structs by reflection:

- `create role`, `create/update distribution`, `attach/detach securitygroup` and four
  `containertask` commands all failed. The reflective call passed the request without the
  `context.Context` that SDK v2 requires, and a `recover` turned the resulting panic into
  an opaque error.
- 35 parameters taking a list of strings panicked: v1 modeled them as `[]*string`, v2 uses
  `[]string`.
- 13 parameters taking a list of structs panicked, for the same reason.
- `create instance count` reached neither `MinCount` nor `MaxCount`, from a
  one-character typo in a struct tag (`awsin64`).
- `update classicloadbalancer` silently sent an empty request. Its field paths were
  spelled `Healthcheck` where the SDK field is `HealthCheck`, and an unmatched field is
  skipped rather than reported.
- `create distribution` silently dropped its origin domain, because indexed field paths
  such as `Origins.Items[0].DomainName` were not resolved.
- `create/start/stop instance`, `create listener`, `create loadbalancer` and
  `create targetgroup` panicked on an empty AWS response.
- `create vpc` without `name=` crashed while tagging the new VPC. Every command that
  name-tags shared the fault.
- `awless log` crashed on a comment-only or empty template.

Also fixed:

- **`awless` exited 0 on failure**, which broke shell scripting.
- **A deadlock in the IAM users fetcher**, from a `defer wg.Done()` placed after an early
  return, plus an unsynchronized error flag.
- **Ten fan-out sites leaked goroutines** on the first error and ran unbounded, throttling
  large accounts. All now use a bounded `errgroup`.
- **`awless list --sort` panicked** on mixed-type columns.
- **`awless web` crashed on its own resource page.** The template referenced a field that
  no longer existed, and four of its conditionals were malformed, so those sections never
  rendered.
- **Multi-resource JSON output was unordered**, making it useless for diffing between runs.
- Two crashes in the `-v` network monitor: a divide by zero when every request completed
  within the same instant, and an unbounded allocation when the terminal was narrow.
- `detach instanceprofile` panicked after successfully detaching.

### Security

- **Secrets are no longer written to the template log in cleartext.** Command lines,
  fillers and messages all persisted `password=` values, and `awless log` replayed them.
  They are now redacted at the persistence boundary.
- **A denial of service in `triplestore`'s decoder**: an 11-byte input could request
  3.8 GB and kill the process. Found with fuzzing.
- `govulncheck` runs in CI, and patched a reachable AWS SDK eventstream vulnerability
  (GO-2026-5764).
- Ctrl-C now cancels in-flight AWS calls, via a signal-cancelled root context threaded to
  every request.

### Changed

- **Module path is now `github.com/bootswithdefer/awless`.** Install with
  `go install github.com/bootswithdefer/awless@latest`. The old path installed upstream's
  2018 code rather than this fork.
- **AWS SDK v2** throughout; **Go modules** replacing `dep` and a vendor directory; **Go
  1.26** with the toolchain pinned.
- **`github.com/bootswithdefer/triplestore` v1.0.0** for graph storage, the first tagged
  release that library has ever had.
- **bbolt** replaces the archived `boltdb/bolt`, which crashes under the race detector.
- Archived dependencies replaced: `yaml.v2` → `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3`, `oklog/ulid` → `/v2`,
  `src-d/go-git.v4` → `go-git/go-git/v5`, and `mitchellh/ioprogress` inlined.
- Releases are built by GoReleaser for Linux, macOS and Windows on amd64 and arm64.

### Internal

Not user-facing, but the reason the fixes above were findable:

- **200 acceptance tests covering all 194 commands**, running with no network access. They
  assert the mapping from template params to AWS request fields, which is applied by
  reflection and therefore unchecked by the compiler. Nine of the bugs above were found
  this way.
- 51 linters enabled, including `errcheck`, `errorlint`, `noctx`, `contextcheck`,
  `musttag` and `bidichk`. Test coverage went from 23% to 59%.
- Native Go fuzzing, CI actions pinned to commit SHAs, and a CI job that fails on
  generated-code drift.
- `main` holds the single `os.Exit`; commands return errors, so deferred cleanup runs.
- The template parser's entity list is generated from the command struct tags. Previously
  hand-maintained, it could leave a fully registered command failing with
  `unknown entity`.

## v0.1.11 [2018-06-21]

**Check out our new article** on [Simplified Multi-Factor Authentication](https://medium.com/@awlessCLI/simplified-multi-factor-authentication-for-aws-d703e8d9f332) with `awless`

### Features

- [#71](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/71): Add support for Classic load-balancers:

```
    $ awless list classicloadbalancers
    $ awless create classicloadbalancer name=my-loadb subnets=[sub-123,sub-456] listeners=HTTP:80:HTTP:8080 healthcheck-path=/health/ping  securitygroups=sg-54321 tags=Env:Test,Created:Awless
    $ awless update classicloadbalancer name=my-loadb health-interval=10 health-target=HTTP:80/weather/ health-timeout=300 healthy-threshold=10  unhealthy-threshold=5
    $ awless attach classicloadbalancer name=my-loadb instance=@redis-prod-1
    $ awless delete classicloadbalancer name=my-loadb
```

- [#214](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/214): `AWS_PROFILE` env variable now loaded in `awless` in addition to the deprecated `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` thanks to @alewando
- Better completion for `attach mfadevice` and `attach user` commands
- [#219](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/219): Validate access key and secret key before writing into `~/.aws/credentials` file

### Fixes

- [#220](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/220): Add double quotes to CSV output if needed thanks to @lllama
- Fix compilation error in templates with concatenation and reference (c.f. for example in [this template](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fxaguessy/ef9511bf5ed8f3312904cccb96b818e8/raw/75c0f808220665441055b589be133cf711c64f37/ManageOwnMFA.aws))
- Parse integer beginning with '0' as string (preventing the deletion of the initial '0' for example in `... account.id=0123456789`)

## v0.1.10 [2018-04-13]

### Features

- Much better performance when synchronising all access data (IAM, etc.)
- Create instances now supports distro prompting for CentOS, Amazon Linux 2, CoreOS
   
      $ awless create instance name=myinst distro=amazonlinux:amzn2
      $ awless create instance distro=coreos
      $ awless create instance distro=centos name=myinst

- Avoiding extra throttling: Listing flag `--filter` now passes on the user wanted filtering down to the AWS API when possible so that _less unneeded resources are fetched_, _bandwidth is reduced_ and _some throttling avoided_.
  
  For example:
  
      $ awless ls s3objects --filter bucket=website
      $ awless ls records --filter name=io
      $ awless ls containertasks --filter name=my-task-definition-name

- Support for region embedded in an AWS profile (i.e. shared config files ~/.aws/{credentials,config}). See #181 in Fixes for more details 
      
- [#191](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/191) Attach a certificate to a listener with: `awless listener attach id=... certificate=...` (see awless attach listener -h for more)


### Fixes

- [#200](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/200): Now paging is supported for s3 objects when listing
- [#196](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/196): Regression fix SIGSEV when having AWS config with role assuming
- [#182](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/182): Region embedded in profile taken into account and given correct precedence
- [#144](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/144): Filtering done on AWS side when listing records for a given zone name
- [#172](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/172): Filtering done on AWS side when listing containertasks for a given task definition name

## v0.1.9 [2018-01-16]

**In this release, the local data model has been updated to support multi-account and stale data is removed when upgrading. Local data (ex: used for completion, etc...) will progressively be synced again through your usage of awless. Although, to get all your data now under the new model, you can manually run `'awless sync'`**	

### Features

- Support and seamless sync across multi-account (i.e. multiple profiles) and regions
- Enriched params prompting with optional/skippable but very common params. Can be disabled with `--prompt-only-required` or forced with `--prompt-all` to leverage smart completion for all params
- Automatically complete the username when deleting an access key by its ID, if it is contained in the local graph model:
    * `awless delete accesskey id=ACCESSKEYID`
-  For `awless update stack` param `stackfile` can now slurp yml and json params files. Thanks to @Trane9991 ([#167](https://github.com/wallix/awless/pull/167), [#145](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/145))
- Better completion for template parameters independently of their display name
- Aliases can now be resolved to properties other than IDs. For example, they are resolved to ARN in attach/detach/update/delete policy: `awless attach policy arn=@my-policy-name`
- Running only `awless switch` now returns your current region and profile, allowing a quick and short region/profile lookup
- Better completion of slice properties 

### AWS Services

- Listing of Route53 records now contains a new column for aliases [#181](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/181)
- Create an image from an existing instance. See `awless create image -h`
    * `awless create image instance=@my-instance-name name=redis-image  description='redis prod image'`
    * `awless create image instance=i-0ee436a45561c04df name=redis-image reboot=true`
    * List your images with `awless ls images --sort created`
    * Delete images with an `awless revert ...` or with `awless delete image id=@redis-image`
- [#169](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/169): Start/Stop a RDS database:
    * `awless start database id=my-db-id`
    * `awless stop database id=@my-db-name`
    * `awless restart database id=@my-db-name`
- Restart an EC2 instance
  * `awless restart instance id=id-1234`
  * `awless restart instance ids=@redis-prod-1,@redis-prod-2`
- [#176](https://github.com/wallix/awless/issues/176): Delete a DNS record only by its awless ID (see `awless ls records`) or by its name:
    * `awless delete record id=awls-39ec0618`
    * `awless delete record id=@my.sub.domain.com`

### Fixes

- Fix regression error: errors in dry run showed but where ignored hence user could wrongly confirm to run the template
- Delete a DNS record only by its awless ID

## v0.1.8 [2017-11-29]

### Features

- Better prompting of template parameters
- Overall better logging output of template execution

### AWS Services

- Create a database replica with: `awless create database replica=...`

## v0.1.7 [2017-11-24]

### Features

- Better prompt completion for template parameters
- Create instance/launchconfiguration from community distro names (`awless create instance distro=debian`). In default config value, deprecation of `instance.image` in favor of `instance.distro` (migration should be seamless).
    * `awless create instance distro=redhat:rhel:7.2`
    * `awless create launchconfiguration distro=canonical:ubuntu`
    * `awless create instance distro=debian`
